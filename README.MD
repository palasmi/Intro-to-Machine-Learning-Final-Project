This is my final project for Udacity course Intro to Machine Learning

I share my python code as well as .pkl files containing my dataset, my classifier, and a list of features used.

File *Final_project.pdf* contains summary of my project.

All required files (dataset and tools) to run the code can be downloaded from this [GitHub Page](https://github.com/udacity/ud120-projects).

My files can then be copied to *final_project* folder.
