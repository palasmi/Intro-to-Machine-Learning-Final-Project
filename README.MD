This is my final project for Udacity course Intro to Machine Learning

The goal was to identify persons of interest in the Enron fraud case using financial data and emails of top executives of the company.

I share my python code as well as .pkl files containing my dataset, my classifier, and a list of features used.

File *Final_project.pdf* contains summary of my project.

All required files (dataset and tools) to run the code can be downloaded from this [GitHub Page](https://github.com/udacity/ud120-projects).

My files can then be copied to *final_project* folder.
